JUST over a month ago, Michalis Sarris, a retired World Bank official who served as Cypriot finance minister during the boom years that followed European Union accession in 2004,  signed up for another stint in government. Nicos Anastasiades, the island’s newly elected president, had asked him to return to his old job.

This time the task was much tougher. Mr Sarris knew Cyprus’s oversized banking sector would have to shrink fast and that the cost would be high. The “haircut” on bank deposits demanded by Germany would drive away many Russian and Ukrainian companies that use Cyprus as a base for doing business, providing a comfortable living for several thousand Cypriot lawyers, accountants and bankers. Yet the cost of resisting would be even higher: immediate bankruptcy and a speedy exit from the euro.  

Mr Sarris, a quiet technocrat, and Mr Anastasiades, an argumentative lawyer, were soon at odds with each other and with the so-called eurogroup, the finance ministers from the 17 euro zone member-states. After an unsuccessful trip to Moscow to seek a €5 billion ($6.4 billion) emergency loan, followed by the eurogroup’s rejection of Nicosia’s alternative plan to raise €6 billion to avoid a levy on deposits as well as the collapse of Laiki Bank, the island’s second-largest lender, Mr Sarris threw in the towel. He resigned on April 2nd, hours after completing negotiations on a €10 billion bailout with EU and IMF officials.
