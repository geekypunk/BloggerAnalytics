Envoy? sp?cial.  Avant 1993, Iao Fuhuang - gagnait sa vie en r?parant des montres et en vendant des herbes m?dicinales. Cette ann?e-l?, il se lance dans l\u2019?levage et l\u2019abattage des porcs. Aujourd\u2019hui, ce Chinois de Pujiang, dans le Sichuan, est ? la t?te d\u2019un ?levage de 200 truies gestantes dont les aliments compos?s sont partiellement import?s. Son ?tablissement abat et conditionne 300 000 porcs par an. Ses fournisseurs sont des ?leveurs sp?cialis?s dont le plus petit livre annuellement 200 cochons. Les animaux sont vendus au poids vif, ? un tarif moyen de 5,80 yuans le kilo, soit environ 60 centimes d\u2019euro. L\u2019abattoir emploie 500 personnes qui ne travaillent que de nuit. Ce sont souvent des ?leveurs en contrat avec l\u2019abattoir, des doubles actifs au salaire mensuel de 150 euros. Le travail de nuit a ?t? motiv? par les bas prix de l\u2019?nergie ?lectrique par rapport au tarif de jour. Selon les rares propos de Iao Fuhuang, le gouvernement aide les entrepreneurs comme lui ? se lancer avec des politiques de pr?ts bonifi?s, voire de pr?ts non remboursables. L\u2019abattoir vend un peu de viande fra?che aux d?taillants locaux et beaucoup de pi?ces congel?es dans les grandes villes de la province du Sichuan. Du coup, le poste ?nergie se r?v?le ici le plus co?teux en raison des quantit?s de viandes en stock maintenues ? moins 35 degr?s. Au fil de la conversation avec les journalistes fran?ais, Iao Fuhuang a indiqu? qu\u2019il exportait d?j? de la viande de porc en Russie, au Japon et en Cor?e, son ambition ?tant de se positionner sur le march? de l\u2019Union europ?enne pour certains morceaux nobles. C\u2019est sans doute de bonne guerre dans le cadre de la mondialisation lib?rale. Les porcs chinois sont plus gras que les n?tres pour des raisons g?n?tiques et leur r?gime alimentaire d?s?quilibr? avec trop de f?culents et pas assez de prot?ines v?g?tales, largement utilis?es dans l\u2019alimentation humaine en Chine. Des r?tis et des c?telettes de moindre qualit? produits en Chine peuvent donc co?ter moins cher ? nos sp?cialistes de la restauration collective en - recherche d\u2019?conomies sur la mati?re premi?re. Mais importer du cochon chinois en France et en Europe soul?ve une question relative aux ?missions de CO2. Avant d\u2019engraisser les - cochons abattus chez Iao Fuhuang, il faut transporter sur de longues distances des milliers de tonnes d\u2019aliments sur des camions pollueurs. Une fois les porcs abattus, l\u2019?lectricit? produite ? partir du charbon alimente la cha?ne du froid en magasin. Puis la viande circule dans les - camions frigorifiques jusqu\u2019au port le plus proche, puis sur le bateau cong?lateur avant que des camions frigorifiques ?metteurs de CO2 prennent la rel?ve entre un port europ?en et la destination finale de chaque livraison. ? supposer qu\u2019? l\u2019arriv?e le prix de revient de cette viande soit encore moins ?lev? que celle d\u2019un ?levage fran?ais, peut-on fermer les yeux sur les cons?quences ?cologiques d\u2019un si long voyage dont la seule justification serait l\u2019?conomie de quelques centimes d\u2019euros par kilo de r?ti ? L\u2019OMC ferme les yeux sur cet aspect. Ce qui prouve que l\u2019OMC n\u2019est pas un outil pertinent pour la r?gulation du commerce agricole et alimentaire. G. L.

The Harry Caray Frames bus driver in turn slams down on his brakes, forcing each and every passenger to sway forward from their intrinsic inertial bodies. Finally, the Harry Caray Frames bus driver is able to persist in the route\u2019s progress, but does not simultaneously give up the opportunity to commence anew with some sort of speech therapy concerning oblivious persons of ambulatory slant:\u201CYou know when you decide to pass in front of the bus like that, what you don\u2019t realize is that us drivers have a very narrow range of vision.  We just can\u2019t see you!  If you think it\u2019s a good idea to act like that, go right ahead.  \u2013But just know it\u2019s a good way to get yourself killed\u2026\u201DHe goes on from there, and his preaching voice is eventually swallowed up and fades under the issuance of those customary sounds of the highway: spinning tires, whirring engines, spraying rain, spewing ventilation fans, commuter coughs and sniffles, and other meaningless conversation on board that will typically fall by the wayside of those forgotten and wasted items of this path taken from one time to the next.Soon, the Harry Caray Frames bus driver forgets himself midsentence and in turn shifts his concentration more so to the operation of the bus rather than those articles that may or may not concern the present populace.  His voice halts altogether at last from a gasping murmur, and his head can be observed twisting to-and-fro within the rearview mirror, the bill of his navy blue cap accentuating the constant movement eliciting.  The scene becomes almost hypnotic in relative contrast to its beginnings, there being nothing other than the somnolent hum against a backdrop of grayish fogged and droplet streaked windows, and the rather statuesque quality of the silent souls that essentially await the eventual transformation from the working world to that of the home world.\n\n" <http://slogdiary.blogspot.com/2010/02/10-february-2010-507pm.html>   .

A small breeze whisks at the face as the giant evergreens supply their telling old forest scent. I amble towards the bus stop, my feet hugging the road's edge. I try to maintain that balance between walking into traffic or falling down into a muddy drainage ditch. A woman walks about thirty meters ahead of me wearing a giant shoulder bag and a pair of high heels attempting to sustain the same equivocation. Her pace is slower than my own. I have no desire to catch up so I slow my stroll to match her speed.\n\nI turn my attention elsewhere. My approach to the bus stop for instance. The stop nears, shaded by a cedar tree. The tree drapes its strangely formed leaves over like a shop's awning. I sit myself on the road guardrail. It's not terribly comfortable but it does the job of resting the bum. I notice graffiti scrawled in pubescent script on the galvanized steel extrusion. It's black as if it were made from a \"Sharpie\" or something similar. The vandal apparently possessed a fixation on penises ejaculating. I discern more of the same written on the bus marker and the metal post that supports it.\n\nWith a sigh I again turn my attention elsewhere. The bus is going to come soon. I check my bus \"app\" on the phone. According to the \"app\" it'll be here in seven minutes. I start writing this here meaningless account of nothing important when the sound of the bus jolts me to standing at attention. With a smirk the driver eases the coach to a stop and hisses the door open. I wave my ORCA card (One Regional Card for All) in front of the reader. The reader beeps its acceptance and I move on into the bus. Everyone glances at my passing but quickly avert their gazes at my returning them. A blue-capped fat old man wearing a gray muscle shirt, a hipster attired it hip specs and hip Tshirt sporting hip sideburns, and a Costco employee in uniform are some to name a few. I often violate the \"no eye contact\" rule out of shear spite. I don't know why. Maybe it makes life more interesting. Perhaps I search those eyes for some semblance of a soul that I might have known in a previous life. It could be that I could debunk this antisocial trend we have here in the World of Big City USA, but I doubt it. If there is anything I am not it is a trendsetter. If you saw me on the street you'd take absolutely no notice. If you think I'm joking or exaggerating let me just say I have many years of backing data. I have observations ranging from the sickening emotional to the coldly scientific. You'll see (or not as the case in fact is). One glance at me and you might as well peer at a tree, or a pebble on the side of the road, or even a glade of grass in a middle of an abandoned lot.\n\nThe driver uses a stick to reach up to the display control to change the route information. The route changes numbers from the 331 to the 345. How do I know this? Why the \"app\" of course. The \"app\" has been telling me a lot of things lately. I \u00A0haven't gotten around to trusting it completely yet. I hope one day that time will come. Until then I shall remain apprehensive. However I can't seem to shake my skeptic philosophy, no matter how convincing the counter argument may be. So forget it. My apprehension will remain firmly in place.\n\n" <http://slogdiary.blogspot.com/2011/08/saturday-morning-arrives-on-heels-of.html>   .

As I write here the faded conditions seem to lessen, forecasting a possible reprieve at having to involuntarily stop at a near-event within the future, which is to stop this narrative at what may enter into the equation of the entrance of \u201Creality\u201D as the written word which equals the trance at which produces it. \u2013To have it halt because of the lack of supply over a quick-drying liquid is both cumbersome to the mind and quite annoying in all other respects.  That said, I may then gamble on the prospect that my \u201Cannoyance\u201D may not outweigh the chance at a cooperating sense of creative self, for all too often I find that the timing does not work out, or in other words that the equation is actually a disguised inequality in the strictest sense, and that all lines up adequately all too rarely.***There I was, just finished on a short transit hop from downtown to the arena of SEA-TAC airport, having walked the half mile or so from the station to where I was able to plug in and charge the phone (for another rare thing indeed is the availability of electrical outlets).  I ended up sitting next to a squat woman with spastically teased voluminous hair speaking on the phone concerning IT troubles, presumably on the other end of the line.  She told this \u201Chim\u201D to reinstall and try again to launch whatever application was causing the affront to both their psyches, and if that didn\u2019t work he was to, \u201Ccall the Help Desk.\u201DAfter she hung up an old woman sitting on the opposing side of her had yelped out, \u201CWhy can\u2019t I get this to connect?\u201D with her husband standing over her huffing his exasperation at his wife\u2019s dramatic frustration.What was clear from the body language I observed was that this old woman undoubtedly was attempting to acquire the assistance of the said \u201CIT Professional\u201D with the wacky hair.  \u2013For the old woman, or the Social Vampire as it turned out, produced these furtive glances and dramatic yowls of dissatisfaction at every opening she detected at the I.T. Professional\u2019s demeanor. \u2013But of course how could the I.T. Professional resist this fleeting onslaught of unsaid communiqu?, quite?  Indeed, the I.T. Professional delved immediately into the issue while packing her paraphernalia simultaneously.\u201CDid you accept the terms and agree to connect?\u201D she probed.\u201CNo, how do you do that?\u201D the Social Vampire replied.\u201COnce your wireless adapter connects you must open IE, yes, IE not that other browser, and accept the terms.\u201D\u201CI don\u2019t know if we should take responsibility for an unsecure network!\u201D the Social Vampire\u2019s reclusive spousal unit interjected.\u201CWell, you won\u2019t be able to connect then,\u201D the I.T. Professional said.\u201CWhy is this taking so long?\u201D the Social Vampire whined.\u201CIt\u2019s slow here, sometimes it just takes a while, you just have to be patient with these things!\u201DThe Social Vampire snapped a prudish leer out of the corner of her eye at the I.T. Professional and indicated a \u201Chumph\u201D under her breath.They all wait with baited breath it seemed, as the small laptop labored away at this pointed task as the Social Vampire squirmed in utter vexation.By this time the I.T. Professional was all packed up and ready to take off.\u201CIt\u2019s still not connecting!\u201D the Social Vampire told the I.T. Professional.\u201CYou gotta be patient!\u201D the Social Vampire\u2019s reclusive husband suggested, to which he received a look of absolute reprehension.\u201CYes, but don\u2019t worry, it should connect if you let it do its thing,\u201D the I.T. Professional said as she swung her bag over her shoulder to leave.\u201CBut it's still not connected!\u201D the Social Vampire ululated in a near sob.The I.T. Professional by this point had to depart, and doing so she shrugged her shoulders in a noncommittal sway and left swiftly leaving the Social Vampire with a gaping mouth of incredulity.Just then, out of the corner of my eye I detected the Social Vampire\u2019s stare in my direction for about five straight seconds.  I, in turn kept my eyes unwavering to the object of my attention: a smart phone where I was in the midst of delivering a sentence of snark of no more than one-hundred forty characters about this very subject.Again with loudness, the Social Vampire expressed her displeasure at not being able to connect.Her reclusive husband then said, \u201CYou must be patient dear, and plus if you cannot connect it is really no big deal.\u201D\u201CBut I wanna check my mail!\u201D the Social Vampire verbally lashed, causing her reclusive husband to say in response, \u201CI\u2019m going over there to wait while you do this.\u201D\u201CWhere are you going?\u201D she shouted after him.\u201COver there,\u201D he pointed over to the seats behind me, empty and in a row.\u201CWhat about the bags?\u201D she asked.\u201CWhat about them?\u201D\u201CWho\u2019s going to watch them?\u201D\u201CI\u2019m leaving them here with you.  If you need me I\u2019ll be right there, just call to me.\u201D\u201CThen I gotta lug all the bags over to you,\u201D she growled.\u201CNo.  No you don\u2019t!\u201D he replied with acute irritation.He left while she continued to murmur with marked agitation as she looked over at me, again literally boring her gaze into the side of my head baiting me to help her connectivity issues.I patently decided not to get involved, for through my alleged \u201Cspidey\u201D sense I ascertained a feeling of dread at the prospect: for this was one that conveyed an impression of a perpetual dissatisfaction at just about anything.  There was no pleasing her, no matter the circumstance (a scenario I am unfortunately all too familiar with).Before I was aware at the passage of elapsed time she abruptly called out, \u201CFred, Fred!\u201D in a hoarse but mainly guttural and piercing voice. Her reclusive husband peeked up through his thick rectangular framed glasses and ambled over laboriously while in mid-walk toward us she announced, \u201CSkype\u2019s on! All your kids are on there!\u201DShe then rose so that he could take a seat.  When he did she hurried off without a word.He asked, \u201CWhere are you going?\u201D\u201CTo the gift shop!\u201D she sassed as if his question was the most idiotic ever fathomed in the entire history of the human race.Need I say more?\n\n" <http://slogdiary.blogspot.com/2010/01/25-january-2010-343pm.html>   .
